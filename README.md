# Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)

A Django-based network intrusion detection system with hierarchical machine learning capabilities.

## Features

- Real-time network traffic monitoring
- Signature-based detection
- Anomaly-based detection
- Machine learning-based detection
- Hierarchical multi-stage classification
- RESTful API for integration
- Dashboard for monitoring and analysis

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run migrations: `python manage.py migrate`
4. Create a superuser: `python manage.py createsuperuser`
5. Run the server: `python manage.py runserver`

## Running the Packet Capture

To start monitoring network traffic:

```bash
python manage.py run_packet_capture start --interface eth0
```

To stop monitoring:

```bash
python manage.py run_packet_capture stop
```

To check the status of monitoring interfaces:

```bash
python manage.py run_packet_capture status
```

## Machine Learning Models

The system uses a hierarchical multi-stage approach for intrusion detection:
1. Binary classification (Normal vs. Attack)
2. Attack category classification
3. Specific attack type classification
